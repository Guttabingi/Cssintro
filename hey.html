    <h1>Novels aka Books</h1>
    
    <h3>6 Reasons why you should read novels aka books</h3>
    <div>
        <p id="one">1.Reading fiction, it turns out, is a great way to develop your social brain. Research shows that reading novels, for example, shapes our brains and moulds our social skills.</p>
        <p id="two">2.It also allows you to “live in other people’s brains”. The result is a stronger theory of mind</p>
        <p  id="thri">3.The practice of reading books creates cognitive engagement that improves lots of things, including vocabulary, thinking skills, and concentration.</p>
        <p id="for">4.It can even improve memory and critical thinking skills. And activities like reading have been linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p id="fyv">5.Modern life is stressful - period. Reading may reduce stress more than walking, listening to music or playing games. When people read a really engrossing book it actively engages their imagination, which in turn distracts from daily stresses (at least for a little while)</p>
        <p id="six">6.Reading aloud to children from day one is incredibly important. And making it part of the daily routine helps children to cultivate good reading habits and a love of reading. It can have a lasting impact on a child's life. These children tend to have higher vocabularies and often become frequent readers themselves</p>
